# Exactly indexing server

This is the indexing server for [Exactly](https://github.com/mlinhard/exactly) written in *Go* language. It uses [sais-go](https://github.com/mlinhard/sais-go) which is Go language wrapper for Yuta Mori's [SAIS implementation](https://sites.google.com/site/yuta256/sais) for fast suffix array construction.
